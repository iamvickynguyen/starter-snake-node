## Flow:
1. eat food until length is long enough (how long?) </br>
while:
&nbsp;  2. find good position </br>
&nbsp;  3. secure 1 food </br>
&nbsp;  4. chase tail around the food, keep enough space to get out (how?)</br>
&nbsp;  5. keep the space inside as big as possible </br>
&nbsp;  5. eat it when blood <= 10 </br>
&nbsp;  6. kill others if we have a chance (kill?)</br>
&nbsp;  7. if no available move, chase tail until death </br>

## TO DO:
1. How can we do it? (1/1/2021) </br>
2. Implement algorithms? </br>
3. Brainstorm edge cases (consider if flow is good enough)? (1/1/2021)
